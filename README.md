# Weather Dashboard

# Introduction
Welcome to Weather Dashboard.  As a busy student, I want to be able to go
to a website and get the most accurate current weather and weather forecast
I can to plan my day and week.
This is a website that uses Open Weather Map API to provide current weather as well as a 5 day forecast for the city entered into the search box.
